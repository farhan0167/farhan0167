I am a senior attending Baruch College, pursuing a BBA in Computer Information System with an interest in Software Engineering, and a minor in Mathematics.

I'm currently using React.js and Flask to build web services during my free time. I'm passionate about technology and its power to transform our lives in the wake of the new decade. While I value the software's technical aspects, I also emphasize and constantly seek to learn how to make software more user-friendly and have the most impact in our lives. It is important for me to think outside the box and to bring creativity in solving problems.

I am also interested in arts and graphic design. Currently I picked up digital painting to further expand on a hobby of painting I had since the age of 5. Apart from painting, I also use my time to take cityscape photographs within New York City.
