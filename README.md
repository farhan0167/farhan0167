# Ahmad Farhan Ishraq

I am a final-year MS student at NYU Tandon studying Computer Engineering. My interests are in the areas of software development/ software engineering and machine learning. 

Currently, I am working as a full-stack web developer at the Endless Frontier Labs at NYU Stern. I am migrating the department's old web application to a newly designed application. I also work with the office to solve their day-to-day operational challenges by implementing software solutions that make our work more efficient. 

I have experience building web applications and tools in Python, Javascript, React, Node. As part of my graduate education, I have experience building machine learning/ deep learning models with a focus in computer vision, NLP and graph neural networks. I also like to break things I make, such as mounting adversarial attacks on neural networks and then securing them. I also study network design (Data Centers) and network security, with exposure to topology design and implementation, TCP/IP, Key Distribution, and Cloud Computing.
